# survey-app-vue

This application consists of three main views: HomeView, SurveyView, and SurveyResultView.  
HomeView displays a list of ongoing surveys. Users can select a survey to answer its questions or navigate to the results page.  
SurveyView presents the survey questions. Each question must be answered; otherwise, the form cannot be submitted. SurveyResultView shows the survey results, including the average score for each question and the total number of responses.
